# Third Party Notices

This repository includes design documentation that references external open source background-agent and Slack bot projects as prior art. Those references are for architecture comparison and implementation guidance.

As of this notice, this repository does not intentionally vendor source code, assets, or substantial copied documentation from the projects listed below. If future work copies implementation code, configuration, schemas, tests, fixtures, or substantial prose from these projects, preserve the applicable license headers and update this file with the copied material, source project, upstream commit or version when known, and any local modifications.

This file is a compliance checkpoint for contributors and coding agents. It is not legal advice.

## Contributor Guidance

- Summarizing ideas, architecture, behavior, and public APIs usually does not require copying license text, but attribution in prior-art docs is still useful.
- Copying code, test fixtures, schemas, config files, prompts, specs, or substantial documentation usually requires preserving license notices.
- Prefer clean-room reimplementation from understood behavior when practical.
- When copying is intentional, keep copied sections small, retain upstream headers, and add a note here that identifies the source and local changes.
