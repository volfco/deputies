# Sandbox Providers

## Goal

The system must support multiple sandbox providers without changing session, message, worker, integration, or Flue runner code. Provider-specific behavior belongs behind a stable sandbox provider interface plus capability flags.

Initial providers may include:

- `fake`: deterministic tests.
- `local-docker`: local development and CI smoke tests.
- `daytona`: hosted persistent development sandboxes.
- `kubernetes`: pods/jobs inside a cluster.
- `ecs`: Fargate tasks in AWS.
- `modal` or others later, if desired.

## Design Rule

The worker coordinates product sandbox lifecycle through the provider interface. The Flue runner receives a Flue-compatible sandbox connector derived from the provider handle.

No module outside `sandbox` and provider-specific adapters should know whether a session is running on Docker, Daytona, Kubernetes, ECS, or a fake test provider.

Flue already defines the runtime sandbox shape through `SandboxFactory` and `SessionEnv`. Our provider interface should not become a second agent filesystem/tool runtime. It should own lifecycle concerns that Flue intentionally does not own for our product: create, reconnect, health, destroy, snapshots, persisted provider IDs, and provider capabilities.

## Provider Interface

```ts
export interface SandboxProvider {
  readonly name: string;
  readonly capabilities: SandboxCapabilities;

  create(input: CreateSandboxInput): Promise<SandboxHandle>;
  connect(input: ConnectSandboxInput): Promise<SandboxHandle>;
  destroy(input: DestroySandboxInput): Promise<void>;

  health(input: SandboxRef): Promise<SandboxHealth>;

  snapshot?(input: SnapshotSandboxInput): Promise<SandboxSnapshot>;
  restore?(input: RestoreSandboxInput): Promise<SandboxHandle>;
  stop?(input: StopSandboxInput): Promise<void>;
  start?(input: StartSandboxInput): Promise<SandboxHandle>;
  logs?(input: SandboxLogsInput): AsyncIterable<SandboxLogEvent>;
}
```

Only `create`, `connect`, `destroy`, and `health` are mandatory. Snapshot, restore, stop, start, and logs are optional capabilities.

## Core Types

```ts
export type SandboxCapabilities = {
  persistentFilesystem: boolean;
  snapshots: boolean;
  stopStart: boolean;
  exec: boolean;
  filesystem: boolean;
  streamingLogs: boolean;
  portForwarding: boolean;
  objectStorageArtifacts: boolean;
};

export type CreateSandboxInput = {
  sessionId: string;
  repo?: RepoRef;
  baseBranch?: string;
  workingBranch?: string;
  image?: string;
  env?: Record<string, string>;
  resources?: SandboxResources;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
};

export type ConnectSandboxInput = {
  providerSandboxId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
};

export type SandboxRef = {
  providerSandboxId: string;
  sessionId: string;
};

export type SandboxHandle = SandboxRef & {
  provider: string;
  workspacePath: string;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
  capabilities: SandboxCapabilities;
  exec(command: SandboxExecInput): Promise<SandboxExecResult>;
  fs?: SandboxFileSystem;
  ports?: SandboxPorts;
};
```

## Execution API

Every production provider must support command execution directly or through an attached bridge.

```ts
export type SandboxExecInput = {
  command: string;
  cwd?: string;
  env?: Record<string, string>;
  timeoutMs?: number;
  stdin?: string;
};

export type SandboxExecResult = {
  exitCode: number;
  stdout: string;
  stderr: string;
  startedAt: Date;
  completedAt: Date;
};
```

Rules:

- Providers must not throw for non-zero process exit codes. Return `exitCode` instead.
- Providers should throw for infrastructure failures: sandbox missing, network failure, timeout connecting to provider API.
- Output should be bounded by provider or caller limits to avoid memory exhaustion.
- Secrets must not be logged by provider adapters.

## Filesystem API

Flue sandbox connectors need filesystem operations. A provider can implement these natively or by translating them into commands inside the sandbox.

```ts
export interface SandboxFileSystem {
  readFile(path: string): Promise<string>;
  readFileBuffer(path: string): Promise<Uint8Array>;
  writeFile(path: string, contents: string | Uint8Array): Promise<void>;
  stat(path: string): Promise<SandboxFileStat>;
  readdir(path: string): Promise<SandboxDirEntry[]>;
  exists(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  mkdir(path: string, options?: { recursive?: boolean }): Promise<void>;
  rm(path: string, options?: { recursive?: boolean; force?: boolean }): Promise<void>;
}
```

This mirrors the Flue connector shape closely enough that `runner-flue` can adapt a `SandboxHandle` into a Flue sandbox factory.

## Lifecycle Semantics

### Create

`create()` provisions a new sandbox and returns once it can accept commands.

Provider responsibilities:

- Provision the compute environment.
- Install or select a usable base image.
- Return a stable provider sandbox ID.
- Return the workspace path.
- Attach metadata needed to reconnect later.

Optional responsibilities by provider policy:

- Clone the repo.
- Run setup hooks.
- Start a bridge process.
- Preconfigure Git credentials.

### Connect

`connect()` reconnects to an existing provider sandbox ID after process restart or worker handoff.

Provider responsibilities:

- Validate the sandbox still exists.
- Return an executable handle.
- Avoid creating a new sandbox unless the provider explicitly documents reconnect-as-recreate behavior.

### Health

`health()` checks whether the sandbox exists and can accept work.

Suggested result:

```ts
export type SandboxHealth = {
  status: 'ready' | 'starting' | 'stopped' | 'unhealthy' | 'missing';
  message?: string;
  checkedAt: Date;
};
```

For providers with `exec`, a simple `echo ok` style command is acceptable as the default health check.

### Destroy

`destroy()` tears down provider resources.

Rules:

- It must be idempotent.
- Missing sandbox should be treated as success.
- It must not delete database state. The caller owns DB updates.

### Snapshot And Restore

Snapshot support is optional.

Providers with snapshots should return:

```ts
export type SandboxSnapshot = {
  provider: string;
  snapshotId: string;
  sourceSandboxId: string;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
  createdAt: Date;
};
```

The worker can use snapshots as an optimization, not as a correctness requirement.

## Provider Capabilities

Provider-specific differences should be expressed through capabilities, not `if provider === ...` checks scattered through the codebase.

Examples:

| Capability | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `persistentFilesystem` | Files survive between runs without snapshot restore. |
| `snapshots` | Provider can save and restore filesystem state. |
| `stopStart` | Provider can stop and later restart the same sandbox. |
| `exec` | Provider supports direct command execution. |
| `filesystem` | Provider supports file operations without shelling out. |
| `streamingLogs` | Provider can stream runtime logs. |
| `portForwarding` | Provider can expose dev server ports. |

The lifecycle manager should select behavior based on capabilities.

## Flue Connector Adapter

`runner-flue` should adapt `SandboxHandle` into Flue's `SandboxFactory` contract.

Conceptually:

```ts
function toFlueSandboxFactory(handle: SandboxHandle): SandboxFactory;
```

The returned `SandboxFactory` creates Flue `SessionEnv` instances backed by the provider handle.

Required mapping:

```txt
Flue exec -> SandboxHandle.exec
Flue readFile -> SandboxHandle.fs.readFile or shell fallback
Flue writeFile -> SandboxHandle.fs.writeFile or shell fallback
Flue readdir/stat/exists/mkdir/rm -> SandboxHandle.fs or shell fallback
```

If a provider lacks native filesystem APIs, the adapter may implement them with safe shell commands. That fallback must quote paths safely and reject unsupported path shapes.

## Provider Examples

### Fake Provider

Purpose:

- Unit, integration, and e2e tests.

Behavior:

- Always returns a ready sandbox.
- `exec()` returns scripted outputs.
- Filesystem is in memory.
- No network or real process execution.

### Local Docker Provider

Purpose:

- Local development and CI smoke tests.

Behavior:

- Creates Docker container per session.
- Uses bind mount or named volume for workspace.
- Executes commands via Docker exec.
- Destroy removes container and optional volume.

### Daytona Provider

Purpose:

- Hosted persistent dev environments.

Behavior:

- Creates Daytona sandbox/workspace.
- Reconnects by provider sandbox ID.
- Uses Daytona exec/filesystem APIs where available.
- May support persistent filesystem better than snapshots.

### Kubernetes Provider

Purpose:

- Cluster-native deployments.

Behavior:

- Creates Pod or Job per session.
- Uses PVC for persistent workspace if needed.
- Executes commands via Kubernetes exec API.
- Health checks pod phase and optional exec probe.
- Destroy deletes pod/job and optional PVC depending on retention policy.

### ECS Provider

Purpose:

- AWS-native Fargate deployments.

Behavior:

- Starts task per session.
- Uses EFS for persistent workspace if needed.
- Requires a bridge or sidecar API for exec/filesystem operations, since ECS Exec is not ideal as a high-level filesystem API.
- Health checks task status and bridge readiness.
- Destroy stops task.

## Bridge Pattern

Some providers cannot provide convenient filesystem and exec APIs directly. Those providers should run a sandbox bridge inside the environment.

Bridge responsibilities:

- Expose authenticated HTTP or WebSocket control API.
- Execute commands.
- Perform filesystem operations.
- Stream logs/events.
- Report heartbeat.

The provider adapter then talks to the bridge instead of provider-native exec APIs.

This is especially useful for ECS, Kubernetes, and any provider with awkward remote exec semantics.

## Conformance Tests

Every provider must pass the same conformance suite.

Required tests:

- `create()` returns a handle with provider sandbox ID and workspace path.
- `health()` reports ready after create.
- `connect()` reconnects to the same sandbox.
- `exec()` returns stdout, stderr, and exit code.
- Non-zero command returns `exitCode`, not thrown error.
- `writeFile()` then `readFile()` round trips content.
- `mkdir()` and `readdir()` work.
- `rm()` removes files/directories.
- `destroy()` is idempotent.
- Missing sandbox health returns `missing` or `unhealthy`.

Optional capability tests run only when capability flags are enabled:

- snapshot and restore preserve files.
- stop and start preserve workspace if `persistentFilesystem` is true.
- port forwarding exposes a test HTTP server.
- streaming logs produce expected output.

## Error Model

Provider errors should be normalized.

```ts
export class SandboxProviderError extends Error {
  provider: string;
  code:
    | 'not_found'
    | 'auth_failed'
    | 'quota_exceeded'
    | 'timeout'
    | 'network'
    | 'unhealthy'
    | 'unsupported'
    | 'unknown';
  retryable: boolean;
  details?: unknown;
}
```

The worker uses `retryable` to decide whether to retry, recreate, or fail the message.

## Persistence

Provider adapters return metadata. The sandbox module persists it in the `sandboxes` table.

Persisted fields:

- provider name.
- provider sandbox ID.
- session ID.
- status.
- workspace path.
- snapshot ID, if any.
- provider metadata needed to reconnect.

Provider adapters must not write directly to the database.

## Security

Rules:

- Provider adapters must not log raw environment variables or credentials.
- Any bridge API must require per-sandbox authentication.
- Sandbox tokens must be scoped to one sandbox/session.
- Provider metadata should not contain raw long-lived credentials.
- Destructive actions must be limited to the provider sandbox ID passed by the caller.
- Filesystem APIs must prevent accidental host path traversal for local providers.

## MVP Recommendation

Implement providers in this order:

1. `fake`, required for tests.
2. `local-docker`, useful for local and CI validation.
3. One hosted provider, likely Daytona, Kubernetes, or ECS depending on the first deployment target.

This order proves the interface before committing to any one infrastructure platform.

## Relationship To Flue's Daytona Example

Flue's documented remote coding-agent example creates a Daytona sandbox, initializes a setup agent, clones the repo, installs dependencies, then initializes a second project-scoped agent in the same sandbox with `cwd` set to the cloned repo.

Our design should preserve that shape:

```txt
provider lifecycle manager
  -> create/connect sandbox and persist provider sandbox ID
  -> produce Flue SandboxFactory from provider handle

runner-flue
  -> use setup Flue agent for repo clone/sync/setup
  -> use project Flue agent with cwd=/workspace/project for user prompt
```

The difference from Flue's minimal example is durability and policy:

- The product records sandbox ownership in `sandboxes`.
- Follow-ups should reconnect to the same sandbox when possible.
- Repo clone should become repo sync after the first run.
- Setup/install hooks should be explicit and observable.
- Cleanup is controlled by product retention policy, not always `cleanup: true`.
