# Integrations

## Principle

Integrations are thin adapters. They authenticate inbound requests, normalize external payloads, map external threads to sessions, enqueue messages, and send callbacks.

They must never run agents directly.

Allowed:

```ts
await enqueueIntegrationMessage(envelope);
```

Forbidden:

```ts
await runner.run(...);
```

## Common Envelope

Every integration should produce the same internal shape.

```ts
type IntegrationEnvelope = {
  source: 'generic-webhook' | 'github' | 'slack' | 'linear';
  externalThreadId?: string;
  dedupeKey?: string;
  actor: {
    externalId: string;
    name?: string;
    email?: string;
  };
  repo?: {
    owner: string;
    name: string;
    defaultBranch?: string;
  };
  prompt: string;
  context: Record<string, unknown>;
  callback?: {
    type: 'http' | 'github' | 'slack' | 'linear';
    target: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

## Shared Flow

```txt
external webhook
  -> verify signature/auth
  -> dedupe delivery
  -> normalize payload to IntegrationEnvelope
  -> resolve external thread mapping
  -> create or find session
  -> append message
  -> return 202 Accepted
  -> worker executes message later
  -> callback dispatcher posts progress/completion
```

## Generic Inbound Webhook

Generic webhook auth is independent of product API auth. Product session routes can use `API_AUTH_MODE=none|bearer|session`, but `POST /webhooks/generic/:sourceKey` always uses the bearer token configured for that webhook source in the database.

The generic webhook is the first integration to implement.

Route:

```txt
POST /webhooks/generic/:sourceKey
```

MVP capabilities:

- Bearer token auth.
- JSON body only.
- Dedupe via request-provided `dedupeKey`.
- External thread reuse via request-provided `threadId`.
- Prompt ingestion via request-provided `prompt` plus optional source prompt prefix.
- Context ingestion via request-provided `context`.
- Optional HTTP completion callback via request-provided `callbackUrl`.

Future capabilities:

- JSON-path mapping/filtering/template configuration.
- HMAC auth.
- Basic auth.
- CIDR allowlist.
- Admin API for source configuration.

Current callback support:

- Generic webhook payloads may include `callbackUrl`.
- On message completion, the worker posts a JSON payload to that URL.
- Callback attempts are persisted in `callback_deliveries`. The dispatcher claims due callbacks, delivers them through target-specific sender plugins, records `callback_sent` on success, schedules retry on transient failure, and records `callback_failed` after terminal failure.

Example config:

```json
{
  "key": "ci-failures",
  "name": "CI Failures",
  "enabled": true,
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "tokenHash": "..."
  },
  "mapping": {
    "externalThreadIdPath": "$.workflow_run.id",
    "dedupeKeyPath": "$.delivery_id",
    "repoPath": "$.repository.full_name",
    "promptPath": "$.message",
    "titlePath": "$.workflow_run.name"
  },
  "filters": [
    { "path": "$.workflow_run.conclusion", "op": "equals", "value": "failure" }
  ],
  "defaults": {
    "promptTemplate": "Investigate this CI failure and propose or implement a fix.\n\nPayload:\n{{json payload}}"
  }
}
```

Session resolution:

```txt
if externalThreadId exists:
  sourceKey + externalThreadId -> existing session or create new
else:
  create new session per accepted delivery
```

## GitHub Integration

GitHub App runtime access should be implemented before inbound GitHub webhooks are treated as production-ready. The webhook path creates sessions and comments, but repo-scoped agent work also needs short-lived installation credentials for clone, fetch, push, branch, PR, and status/comment operations.

Current runtime access support includes GitHub App JWT signing, repository installation lookup, installation token minting, token caching, repository allowlist checks, configurable clone URL generation through `GITHUB_CLONE_BASE_URL`, Flue-runner repository refresh from message repository context, an agent `gh` tool for authenticated GitHub CLI/API operations against the current repository, and an agent `git` tool for authenticated git network operations inside the sandbox repository. The worker only ensures a sandbox exists. When the configured runner is Flue, the runner mints short-lived repository access, sets the agent `cwd` to the repository worktree path, runs a pre-prompt `session.shell` clone/fetch step inside the sandbox, exposes scoped `gh` and `git` tools, then emits `repository_ready` without token material. PR helper operations are still future work.

`GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` and `GITHUB_CLONE_BASE_URL` are intentionally separate. The API base points at GitHub's REST API or an emulator; the clone base points at the git remote host used for clone/fetch/push. Defaults are `https://api.github.com` and `https://github.com`.

Credential handling:

- `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and `GITHUB_APP_ID` stay in service environment/secrets and are used only server-side to sign GitHub App JWTs.
- Installation tokens are minted in memory, cached per installation until near expiry, and are not persisted in messages, events, artifacts, callbacks, or prompts.
- Git clone/fetch auth is passed to Flue `session.shell` as command-scoped env: `GITHUB_AUTH_HEADER=Authorization: Basic base64(x-access-token:<installation-token>)`.
- Shell commands reference only `$GITHUB_AUTH_HEADER`; token values are not embedded in command strings. Flue shell history records env variable names, not values.
- The agent `gh` tool runs in trusted worker code with command-scoped `GH_TOKEN`, `GH_REPO`, a temporary `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, disabled prompts, token redaction, and blocked auth/config/extension/clone escape hatches.
- The agent `git` tool runs the git process inside the remote sandbox repository through Flue agent-level `shell` with command-scoped `GITHUB_AUTH_HEADER`. Agents should use it for authenticated push/fetch/pull operations, not for GitHub issue/comment/PR API work.
- `repository_ready` events contain repository identity, workspace path, and expiry metadata only.

The intended runtime model is snapshot-friendly: Daytona images/snapshots may pre-bake common repos and build artifacts, but every Flue run still refreshes or repairs the requested repository as its first sandbox shell step so reused/stale sandboxes get current code and fresh credentials.

Repository-scoped messages can carry context in either shape:

```json
{ "repository": { "provider": "github", "owner": "owner", "repo": "repo" } }
```

```json
{ "github": { "repository": { "owner": "owner", "repo": "repo" } } }
```

When a message provides repository context through the product API, the repository is also persisted as durable session context. Later messages inherit that repository automatically. Supplying a different repository on a later message updates the session default and overrides the effective context for that message and future follow-ups. Only durable repository context should be promoted to the session; transient integration metadata, callbacks, delivery IDs, and webhook payloads remain message-scoped.

Future multi-repository context should distinguish repository roles instead of treating every cloned repo as equally writable:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    { "provider": "github", "owner": "org", "repo": "app", "role": "primary", "writable": true },
    { "provider": "github", "owner": "org", "repo": "shared-lib", "role": "auxiliary", "writable": false }
  ]
}
```

Planned semantics:

- Exactly one `primary` repository is the default `cwd`, branch target, and expected edit location for normal tasks.
- `auxiliary` repositories are cloned as sibling worktrees for context/reference and are read-only by default.
- A task that intentionally spans multiple repositories should mark each modified repo as `writable: true`; each writable repo should get its own branch/PR artifact plus a summary artifact linking the PR set.
- Snapshot/image baking can pre-populate common primary and auxiliary repositories, but startup refresh still verifies each requested worktree exists and is current enough for the run.
- Prompt context should list each repository role and sandbox path so the agent knows which repo is safe to modify.

Supported triggers:

- Issue comments mentioning the agent.
- PR comments mentioning the agent.
- PR review comments mentioning the agent.
- Optional issue opened or label-based triggers later.

Inbound responsibilities:

- Verify `X-Hub-Signature-256`.
- Dedupe with `X-GitHub-Delivery`.
- Ignore irrelevant events and bot loops.
- Detect trigger phrases.
- Resolve repo, issue, PR, comment, actor, and installation ID.
- Fetch relevant issue/PR context when needed.
- Mark PR/comment bodies as untrusted prompt content.

External thread IDs:

```txt
github:owner/repo:issue:123
github:owner/repo:pr:456
```

Callback responsibilities:

- Post start/completion/failure comments when configured.
- Post PR URL when an artifact is created.
- Avoid noisy tool-level updates unless explicitly enabled.

Testing should use `vercel-labs/emulate` GitHub service where possible:

- Seed users, org, repo, issue, PR, GitHub App installation.
- Send realistic webhooks to the app.
- Assert sessions/messages are created.
- Assert comments or PRs are created in the emulated GitHub API.
- Assert duplicate deliveries are ignored.

Current emulator caveat: published `emulate@0.5.0` rejects valid GitHub App JWTs during installation token minting because of upstream issue [vercel-labs/emulate#96](https://github.com/vercel-labs/emulate/issues/96). The GitHub emulator token-flow test is committed but hard-skipped until a fixed emulate release is available. Real-provider smoke coverage is opt-in:

```sh
RUN_REAL_GITHUB_APP_UAT=true pnpm --dir api exec vitest run --config vitest.uat.config.ts test/uat/real-github-app.test.ts
RUN_REAL_GITHUB_DAYTONA_UAT=true pnpm --dir api exec vitest run --config vitest.uat.config.ts test/uat/real-github-app.test.ts
```

The first UAT mints a real installation token and performs a non-mutating local `git ls-remote`. The second creates a real Daytona sandbox and verifies the Flue-runner startup path clones/fetches the repository inside the sandbox.

### GitHub Implementation Plan

This plan combines the strongest patterns from Background Agents/Open Inspect and Open SWE while preserving this service's boundaries: integrations normalize external events, workers own sandbox lifecycle, Flue owns runner startup shell setup, and GitHub-specific API/push/PR details stay in GitHub adapters.

#### 1. Webhook ingress and dedupe

Implement public `POST /webhooks/github/events` before adding any GitHub-created work to production.

- Read the raw request body and verify `X-Hub-Signature-256` with HMAC SHA-256 against `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
- Fail closed when the webhook secret is missing or the signature is invalid.
- Require and persist `X-GitHub-Delivery` in `integration_deliveries` with source `github`.
- Use a two-phase delivery state inspired by Background Agents: mark as received/processing before async work, mark processed after successful enqueue, and mark failed with a retryable error when enqueue fails.
- Ignore duplicate deliveries without creating new sessions/messages.
- Record structured delivery metadata only: event name, action, repository, sender, issue/PR/comment IDs, and skip reason. Do not persist payload bodies unless explicitly needed and sanitized.

Acceptance criteria:

- Invalid signatures return `401`.
- Missing secrets reject webhooks instead of silently accepting them.
- Duplicate delivery IDs are idempotent.
- Failed processing leaves enough metadata for operator diagnosis without storing GitHub tokens or large raw payloads.

#### 2. GitHub event normalization and gating

Normalize raw GitHub payloads into a small internal event shape before session/message creation.

- Support `issue_comment.created`, `pull_request_review_comment.created`, and selected `pull_request` actions first.
- Add stable `triggerKey` and `concurrencyKey` fields, e.g. `issue_comment:<commentId>`, `pr:<number>`, and `issue:<number>`.
- Resolve repository as `{ provider: 'github', owner, repo }` and attach it to message context so the Flue runner startup step can clone/fetch it inside the sandbox before the agent prompt.
- Ignore bot/self comments to avoid loops.
- Enforce `GITHUB_ALLOWED_REPOSITORIES` before any API fetch or session creation.
- Add caller gating after repo allowlist: either explicit allowed GitHub users or collaborator permission check requiring `write`, `maintain`, or `admin`.
- Add best-effort `eyes` reaction for accepted comments/review comments after gating succeeds.

Acceptance criteria:

- Unsupported actions are acknowledged and skipped with a reason.
- Unauthorized repositories/users do not create sessions/messages.
- Accepted events include normalized context and repository setup context.

#### 3. Repository extraction utilities

Add a reusable repo parser for non-GitHub-webhook sources and manual prompts, based on Open SWE's pragmatic extraction rules.

- Support `repo:owner/name` and `repo owner/name`.
- Support GitHub URLs such as `https://github.com/owner/repo`.
- Prefer explicit `repo:` or `repo ` syntax over URLs when both are present.
- Do not add a default owner unless there is an explicit product setting; absent defaults should return no repository.
- Normalize trailing slashes and reject ambiguous or invalid values.

Acceptance criteria:

- Slack/Linear/manual sources can opt into the same parser later without importing GitHub webhook handlers.
- Unit tests cover explicit repo syntax, URLs, precedence, trailing slashes, and invalid inputs.

#### 4. Thread mapping and follow-up context

Use deterministic external thread IDs so GitHub follow-ups reuse the correct session.

- Map issues to `github:<owner>/<repo>:issue:<issueNumber>`.
- Map PRs to `github:<owner>/<repo>:pr:<prNumber>`.
- For PR review comments, use the PR external thread and include review-comment metadata in the message context.
- Fetch enough context for the first accepted event: issue/PR title, body, author, relevant comments, review comments, and diff hunk when available.
- For later mentions, include only unprocessed comments since the last accepted GitHub mention when feasible.
- Bound context sizes: cap issue/PR body previews, diff hunks, and comment counts.

Acceptance criteria:

- Repeated comments on the same issue/PR enqueue follow-up messages on the existing session.
- Concurrent messages for the same session are handled by the existing queue/batch behavior.
- Large PR/issue payloads do not produce unbounded prompts.

#### 5. GitHub prompt safety wrappers

Adopt Open SWE's compact safety pattern for GitHub-originated content.

- Wrap untrusted GitHub text in reserved tags, e.g. `<github_untrusted_content ...>`.
- Sanitize those reserved tags if they appear inside user-controlled GitHub content.
- Keep the heavy trust guidance in a shared GitHub prompt preamble or system section rather than repeating bulky warnings around every comment.
- Preserve readable author/source labels for comments, review comments, PR titles, bodies, branch names, and diff hunks.
- Add snapshot tests for prompt construction and tag sanitization.

Acceptance criteria:

- Prompt tests prove external content cannot spoof trusted wrapper boundaries.
- GitHub prompts remain compact while clearly separating task instructions from untrusted GitHub text.

#### 6. Callback comments and completion behavior

Implement GitHub callback delivery through the generic callback core instead of relying only on prompt instructions.

- Add a GitHub callback sender for final completion, failure, and PR/artifact links.
- Post sparse comments by default: accepted/start reaction, final summary, failure requiring human attention, and PR URL when created.
- Store callback target metadata, not tokens.
- Use fresh GitHub App access when dispatching callback comments.
- Add manual replay support automatically through the existing callback replay route.

Acceptance criteria:

- Completion comments are visible through emulator-backed tests.
- Failed callback deliveries show in existing callback observability UI and can be replayed.
- GitHub tokens never appear in callback payloads, events, artifacts, or logs.

#### 7. Provider-owned push and PR helpers

Build branch push and PR creation as GitHub/source-control adapter operations, not as worker or runner internals.

- Add branch-name sanitization before any push or PR creation.
- Generate fresh app auth for each push/PR operation.
- Build redacted and real push specs in the GitHub adapter; only redacted specs may be logged or persisted.
- Push branch first, verify it succeeded, then create PR.
- Prevent duplicate PR artifacts for the same session unless an explicit update flow is requested.
- Record verified PR URLs as artifacts.
- Allow a later user-OAuth path to override app-token PR creation when product auth exists; keep GitHub App fallback as the first implementation.

Acceptance criteria:

- PR creation cannot claim success without a verified PR URL.
- Invalid branch names are rejected before git commands run.
- Provider-specific URL/token logic stays inside GitHub/source-control adapter modules.

#### 8. Auth refresh for reused sandboxes

Keep runtime GitHub auth fresh whenever a reused sandbox performs repository operations.

- Continue minting/accessing short-lived tokens during Flue runner startup setup for clone/fetch.
- Re-mint or refresh auth before push/PR operations, not only at sandbox creation time.
- If a future sandbox provider supports outbound proxy or secret injection, implement it behind the sandbox provider boundary; do not require it for all providers.
- Prefer Flue `session.shell(..., { env })` command-scoped auth for Daytona until a stronger provider-native mechanism exists.

Acceptance criteria:

- Stopped/restarted sandboxes can fetch/push with fresh credentials.
- Token refresh is tested independently from sandbox creation.
- No provider-specific proxy requirement leaks into the core sandbox interface.

#### 9. Tests and emulator coverage

Add focused unit tests first, then emulator-backed integration tests.

- Unit-test webhook signature verification, delivery dedupe, normalization, repo extraction, permission gating decisions, prompt wrappers, and branch sanitization.
- Use fake GitHub clients for token, permission, comment, branch, push, and PR flows.
- Add opt-in emulator tests that seed GitHub users/repos/issues/PRs/installations, send webhooks, process worker runs, and assert comments/PRs in the emulator once `emulate` has a fixed GitHub App JWT verification release.
- Keep real GitHub App and real GitHub + Daytona smoke tests opt-in and skipped by default.
- Add regression tests proving token strings are absent from events, messages, artifacts, callback payloads, and logs under controlled fakes.

Acceptance criteria:

- Phase 9 can be verified without real GitHub credentials in CI-like local runs.
- Real-provider smoke testing remains opt-in and never runs by default.

## Slack Integration

See [Slack Testing](./slack-testing.md) for real Slack, tunnel, and emulate workflows.

Supported triggers:

- App mentions.
- Thread follow-ups.
- Direct messages later.

Inbound responsibilities:

- Verify Slack signing secret.
- Enforce optional team/channel/user allowlists.
- Handle Slack URL verification challenge.
- Dedupe by Slack event ID.
- Ignore bot/self events.
- Resolve Slack thread to session.
- Strip the bot mention from app mention prompts.
- Include prior unprocessed Slack thread messages as background context when the bot is tagged later in a thread.
- Resolve readable Slack channel and user names for prompts when Slack API scopes allow it.
- Resolve repo from explicit syntax, defaults, or classifier later.

External thread ID:

```txt
slack:team_id:channel_id:thread_ts
```

Callback responsibilities:

- Reply in thread with session start.
- Reply with final result or PR URL.
- Reply with failures that require human attention.
- Keep progress messages sparse by default.

Testing should use `vercel-labs/emulate` Slack service:

- Seed team, bot, users, channels.
- Post messages and thread replies through emulated Slack APIs.
- Send app mention payloads to the app.
- Assert callback messages are visible in the emulated thread.

Current implementation:

- `POST /webhooks/slack/events` handles Slack Events API payloads.
- `url_verification` returns the Slack challenge after signature verification.
- Optional `SLACK_ALLOWED_TEAM_IDS`, `SLACK_ALLOWED_CHANNEL_IDS`, and `SLACK_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` comma-separated allowlists reject unauthorized events before session/message creation. Slack is fail-closed when `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` is set: at least one allowlist is required unless `UNSAFE_ALLOW_ALL_SLACK_IDS=true` is explicitly configured.
- `app_mention` creates or reuses a session keyed by `team_id:channel:thread_ts`.
- `message` events are accepted only as thread follow-ups, not as new top-level sessions.
- Thread follow-ups mapped to archived sessions are acknowledged and ignored so archived sessions remain read-only. When Slack replies are configured, the bot posts an in-thread notice explaining that the session must be restored first.
- Duplicate `event_id` values are ignored through `integration_deliveries`.
- Bot messages are ignored to prevent loops.
- Accepted Slack messages get a best-effort `:eyes:` reaction when `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` has `reactions:write`.
- Tagged Slack thread messages can include fetched prior thread replies as prior-message context. Context messages whose Slack `ts` already exists on prior product messages are omitted to avoid replaying already processed requests.
- Prompts use Slack channel/user names when `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` has `channels:read` or `groups:read` for channel lookup and `users:read` for user lookup; raw Slack IDs remain in message context only.
- Running Slack-originated work gets a best-effort `:hourglass_flowing_sand:` reaction through the Slack progress notifier plugin.
- Completed Slack replies get a best-effort `:white_check_mark:` reaction through the Slack callback sender.
- `api/src/integrations/slack` owns Slack auth, types, prompts, client helpers, and service orchestration. It must not import runners, sandboxes, or Flue.

Local HTTPS emulation:

```sh
portless proxy start
pnpm dlx emulate start --service slack --portless
```

Then point Slack client config at:

```txt
SLACK_API_BASE_URL=https://slack.emulate.localhost/api
```

Automated tests should prefer the programmatic `createEmulator({ service: 'slack' })` API. Do not add emulate to Docker Compose by default; Compose remains for infrastructure dependencies such as Postgres.

## Linear Integration

Linear does not currently have an obvious emulator in `vercel-labs/emulate`. Use a local fake HTTP server or integration test fixtures first.

Supported triggers:

- Issue assigned to agent.
- Comment mentioning the agent.
- Follow-up comments on mapped issues.
- Stop/cancel action later.

Inbound responsibilities:

- Verify Linear signature.
- Dedupe deliveries.
- Resolve issue and actor.
- Resolve repo from explicit text, project mapping, team mapping, previous session, or classifier.
- Fetch issue title, description, comments, and attachments.

External thread ID:

```txt
linear:issue_id
```

Callback responsibilities:

- Post agent activity updates.
- Link session and PR artifacts.
- Report failure with useful next step.

## Callback Dispatcher

Callbacks should consume normalized internal events, not runner internals.

Input:

```txt
event appended
  -> callback dispatcher evaluates subscriptions/callback targets
  -> formats source-specific update
  -> posts to external service
  -> records callback_sent, callback_retry_scheduled, or callback_failed
```

Default callback policy:

- `run_started`: optional, source-specific.
- `artifact_created` with PR: notify.
- `run_completed`: notify.
- `run_failed`: notify.
- Tool events and text deltas: do not notify externally by default.

Current implementation:

- Completion callbacks are enqueued during worker finalization instead of requiring immediate delivery to complete the run.
- The worker dispatches due callbacks when no session message is available to claim.
- Callback sender plugins keep concrete integration clients out of callback core. Slack provides `SlackCompletionCallbackSender` from `api/src/integrations/slack`.
- Retry uses exponential backoff with jitter and terminal failure after `max_attempts`.
- Session-scoped API/UI controls show callback delivery status and can requeue failed deliveries for manual replay without re-running the agent task.

## Auth Model

Separate inbound verification from outbound API credentials.

| Integration | Inbound | Outbound |
|---|---|---|
| Generic webhook | Bearer/HMAC/basic | Optional HTTP callback auth |
| GitHub | Webhook secret | GitHub App token, optional user OAuth |
| Slack | Signing secret | Slack bot token |
| Linear | Webhook secret | Linear API token |

Credential handling rules:

- Store references or encrypted payloads, not raw tokens in messages/events.
- Mint short-lived GitHub App installation tokens at runtime.
- Redact tokens from logs and events.
- Keep outbound client base URLs configurable for emulator-backed tests.

## Prompt Construction

Integration prompt builders should produce structured, source-specific context while sharing common safety language.

Required sections:

- Source and actor.
- Repository, if known.
- External object metadata.
- User request.
- Relevant context.
- Explicit untrusted-content boundary for external comments/bodies.

Prompt templates live in `api/src/prompts`, not inside route handlers.
