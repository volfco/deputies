# Architecture

## Summary

The system is a portable background-agent control plane with Flue as the agent runtime. Flue already provides agent sessions, tools, skills, tasks/subagents, live events, and sandbox connector abstractions. This service provides the product control plane around those capabilities: durable queueing, leases, integrations, artifacts, replayable events, and portable deployment state.

The system should be deployable to:

- Railway: one service plus Postgres, with optional object storage and Redis later.
- ECS Fargate + RDS: one task/service plus RDS, optionally split into API and worker services.
- Kubernetes: one Deployment plus Postgres and object storage, optionally split into multiple Deployments.

Cloud-specific primitives such as Durable Objects, D1, KV, or provider-native queues must not be required for correctness.

## Initial Deployment Shape

```txt
background-agent service
  Hono HTTP API
  worker loop
  event streaming
  integration routes
  Flue runner adapter
  sandbox lifecycle manager
  Postgres store

Postgres
  sessions
  messages
  events
  runs
  sandboxes
  flue_sessions
  artifacts
  external thread mappings

Object storage, optional at first
  logs
  screenshots
  large artifacts
```

Run modes:

```txt
RUN_MODE=all       # API + worker in one process, default MVP
RUN_MODE=api       # API only, future split
RUN_MODE=worker    # Worker only, future split
```

Process lifecycle:

- `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` trigger graceful shutdown.
- The HTTP server stops accepting new requests.
- Worker polling stops and waits for any in-flight `processNext()` call to finish.
- Postgres-backed stores are closed before process exit.
- Shutdown has a bounded timeout so orchestrators such as Railway, ECS, and Kubernetes can terminate predictably.

The code must behave correctly with multiple replicas even when deployed in `RUN_MODE=all`. Any code path that allocates durable work or processes work must use Postgres-backed concurrency controls from its first implementation. The current store uses database-backed per-session sequence counters and Postgres-backed run leases, including active/cancelling run exclusivity and stale lease recovery.

## Flue Node Deployment Implications

Flue's Node deployment target already builds a Node server with:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /agents`
- `POST /agents/:name/:id`
- sync responses
- live SSE responses
- webhook/fire-and-forget mode

It also supports the Node sandbox progression documented by Flue:

```txt
empty virtual sandbox
  -> virtual sandbox with shell setup
  -> local sandbox using host filesystem
  -> remote sandbox through a connector
```

For this product, there are two viable integration shapes:

1. **Embedded Flue runner inside product API/worker**, preferred for the portable control plane.
2. **Delegate to a generated Flue server**, useful for standalone Flue agents or smoke tests.

The preferred MVP remains embedded Flue execution behind `runner-flue`, because we need durable Postgres-backed queues, run leases, integration dedupe, artifacts, and replayable product events around the agent run. Flue's generated Node server is not a durable work queue by itself.

The implementation should still align with Flue's Node deployment model:

- use `init({ persist })` for Postgres-backed Flue session persistence;
- use `agent.session()` rather than custom conversation history;
- use Flue commands/tools/MCP rather than building a parallel tool registry;
- use Flue sandbox connectors for remote environments;
- treat Flue live events as input to our product event log.

The embedded runner uses Flue the same way the generated Node server does: construct a `createFlueContext()` in the worker process, then call `init()`. The difference is that our `init()` receives a product-managed provider sandbox via a Flue `SandboxFactory`, plus the Postgres-backed Flue `SessionStore`, instead of relying on the generated server's default in-memory store.

Flue live events are normalized before being written to the product event log:

- `text_delta` -> `agent_text_delta`.
- `tool_start` and `command_start` and `task_start` -> `tool_started`.
- `tool_end` and `command_end` and `task_end` -> `tool_finished`.
- low-level lifecycle events such as `agent_start`, `turn_end`, `idle`, and compaction events are currently ignored unless they need product-visible UI later.

## Flue Custom Tools

Flue custom tools passed through `init({ tools })` are the preferred non-MCP extension point when we need authenticated or policy-scoped capabilities that should not expose raw credentials to the agent shell. They are useful for narrow provider actions and pragmatic CLI-backed operations such as the GitHub `gh` tool.

Execution boundary:

- A custom tool handler runs in the trusted worker/runner process that called `init()`, not inside the remote Daytona sandbox.
- The model sees the tool schema, description, arguments, and returned text, but not process-local secrets unless the handler returns them.
- The tool can use service environment variables, minted provider tokens, stores, provider clients, and other backend-only dependencies.
- Tool handlers should return concise structured text and redact secrets from stdout, stderr, API errors, and thrown messages.

Side-effect boundary:

- Provider API side effects happen wherever the provider API applies them, for example creating a GitHub issue or comment.
- Database side effects happen in our service database if the handler calls stores directly.
- Filesystem side effects from ordinary Node filesystem APIs happen in the worker container and usually should be avoided for task workspaces.
- Filesystem side effects intended for the agent workspace must be routed through Flue session/agent shell or sandbox APIs, for example startup `session.shell(...)` or prompt-time agent-level `shell(...)`, so they occur in the remote sandbox worktree.

Security model:

- Custom tools protect the credential boundary by exposing a capability instead of a bearer token.
- They do not automatically protect the permission boundary; broad tools still allow broad behavior within the token/app permissions.
- Keep provider tokens short-lived, repo-scoped when possible, and never persisted in messages, events, artifacts, callbacks, prompts, or Flue session history.
- Validate tool inputs server-side even if the schema is strict; models can still request unsafe or nonsensical operations.
- Prefer product-policy checks in the handler, such as repository allowlists, blocked subcommands, route allowlists, timeouts, non-interactive modes, temporary config directories, and output redaction.
- Log operation metadata and outcomes, not secret-bearing command lines, environment values, or raw provider auth headers.

Choosing an extension point:

- Use a Flue custom tool when the operation belongs to our trusted backend policy layer and can be represented as a model-callable capability.
- Use remote MCP when a high-quality provider MCP server or our own MCP server gives the right tool surface and lifecycle semantics.
- Use `session.shell(..., { env })` for one-off trusted setup commands that must mutate the remote sandbox, such as clone/fetch, with command-scoped credentials.
- Avoid session-scoped shell credentials for general agent use; they are easier to leak into logs, files, command output, model context, or artifacts.
- Avoid `defineCommand` for the current Daytona remote path; it is a local/bash-runtime command registration mechanism and does not provide the same tool surface for our remote sandbox sessions.

Current examples:

- Repository clone/fetch uses `session.shell(..., { env: { GITHUB_AUTH_HEADER } })` because the side effect must create or update files inside the remote sandbox.
- Dynamic repository selection uses the `repository` custom tool. `set` validates and persists session repo context, `list` helps the agent ask for clarification when uncertain, and `prepare` clones/fetches the selected repo inside the sandbox during the active run.
- GitHub issue/PR API operations can use the `gh` custom tool, but final GitHub issue/PR comments are intentionally blocked there and are posted through the callback layer to avoid duplicate external replies.
- Authenticated git network operations such as push use the `git` custom tool. Its handler runs in trusted worker code, but it calls Flue agent-level `shell(...)` so the actual git process and object transfer happen inside the remote sandbox repository with command-scoped credentials while the prompt is active.
- Local file edits and local commits should use sandbox tools such as `write`, `edit`, and `bash`; publishing those commits should use the authenticated `git` tool rather than trying to use `gh` API refs for sandbox-local objects.
- Guardrails block raw GitHub Git Database API routes through `gh` and risky authenticated `git push` forms such as force, mirror, and delete refspecs.

If we later expose raw Flue agent endpoints, they should be clearly separated from product session endpoints:

```txt
/agents/:name/:id             # Flue-native invocation shape
/sessions/:id/messages        # product background-work shape
```

The product API may call into Flue internally, but external integrations should continue to enqueue durable product messages rather than directly relying on Flue's fire-and-forget Node mode.

## Module Layout

Strong module boundaries are also an agent-development constraint, not only a software design preference. Each module should expose small contracts so future coding agents can load the relevant files for one task without pulling the entire system into context. When a feature crosses boundaries, the contract should carry intent in typed inputs/outputs rather than requiring an agent to inspect unrelated internals.

This has practical consequences:

- HTTP routes should call services instead of embedding product logic.
- Hono middleware should own transport-wide concerns like request IDs, auth, CORS, body limits, and error shaping.
- Store implementations should hide SQL details behind narrow methods.
- Integration modules should normalize external payloads before they reach session/message code.
- Runner modules should own runner-specific protocol details and publish normalized events.
- Tests should verify contracts at module boundaries so agents can safely change internals without widening context.

## Responsibility Split

| Module | Owns | Does Not Own |
|---|---|---|
| `api`/`app` | Hono routes, request validation, auth boundaries, response formatting, middleware | Agent execution, sandbox lifecycle decisions |
| `app` | Process bootstrap, run mode, graceful shutdown | Business logic |
| `sessions` | Durable task workspace lifecycle and status | SQL details, Flue calls |
| `messages` | Prompt/follow-up queue semantics | Running prompts |
| `worker` | Claiming runnable work and coordinating execution | HTTP concerns |
| `runner-flue` | Flue initialization and event normalization | Session persistence policy |
| `sandbox` | Provider interface, lifecycle, health, cleanup | Prompt construction |
| `integrations` | External webhook/auth normalization, source-specific prompt rendering, and callbacks | Direct agent execution |
| `events` | Append-only event log, replay, subscriber fanout | Business decisions |
| `artifacts` | PRs, branches, screenshots, object links, reports | Raw runner protocol |
| `store` | Postgres queries, migrations, transactions | Domain decisions |
| `config` | Env parsing, validation, feature flags | Business logic |
| `auth` | App/user/service auth helpers | Route-specific request handling |
| `prompts` | Prompt templates and source-specific context rendering | External API calls |

## Dependency Rules

Allowed dependency direction:

```txt
api -> sessions/messages/events/auth
worker -> messages/sessions/runs/sandbox/runner-flue/events/artifacts
integrations -> sessions/messages/events/prompts/auth
runner-flue -> events/sandbox/prompts
sandbox -> store/config
sessions/messages/runs/events/artifacts -> store
store -> postgres driver + shared record/event types
```

Forbidden dependencies:

```txt
api/app -> runner-flue, except src/index.ts
integrations -> runner-flue
sessions/messages -> integration-specific modules
runner-flue -> api/app/integrations
store -> domain services
```

`api/src/index.ts` is the composition root exception. It is allowed to wire concrete stores, runners, sandboxes, and integrations because process startup is where configuration is translated into concrete dependencies. Other API/app modules must depend on service contracts instead of runner implementations.

Only `runner-flue` should import `@flue/sdk`. This keeps Flue replaceable and makes tests easier. Provider SDKs should stay in provider-specific adapters, such as `api/src/sandbox/daytona.ts` for `@daytona/sdk`. Store implementations may import shared data types, but must not import session/message/event service classes.

The HTTP transport uses Hono on Node via `@hono/node-server`. This keeps the API layer lightweight while giving us middleware hooks for auth, request IDs, CORS, body limits, and route grouping as integrations grow.

Product session routes support `API_AUTH_MODE=none|bearer|session`; the mode is required so deployments fail to start instead of silently running open. `/health` remains public and reports the active mode and session provider. Bearer mode uses `API_BEARER_TOKEN` for machine/developer access. Session mode uses an opaque HTTP-only `dev_deputies_session` cookie backed by the configured `AppStore` (`auth_sessions` in Postgres for durable deployments); the browser never receives user tokens or signed user payloads. `AUTH_PROVIDER=static` enables `POST /auth/login` with local static credentials, while `AUTH_PROVIDER=github` uses GitHub App user authorization through `GET /auth/oauth/github/start` and `GET /auth/oauth/github/callback`. GitHub App login uses `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GITHUB_APP_CALLBACK_URL`; runtime repository access still uses `GITHUB_APP_ID` and `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` to mint installation tokens. Generic webhooks keep their own per-source bearer auth so external systems can be authorized independently from product API clients.

Current session-cookie auth is an API access gate only. Product sessions remain multiplayer/shared by default: authenticated users can list and open the same global session set, and sessions are not currently owned by or filtered to the authenticated user.

Session-scoped product state is exposed through the product API. Artifact reads use `GET /sessions/:sessionId/artifacts` and are protected by the same product session auth as session, message, and event routes.

JSON request bodies are capped by `MAX_JSON_BODY_BYTES` and malformed/non-object bodies produce stable JSON error envelopes. This prevents transport parsing failures from leaking as generic internal errors.

`runner-flue` must also provide or configure a Postgres-backed Flue session store. Flue's Node default is in-memory and is not acceptable for production, CI, UAT, or multi-replica deployments. Product state and Flue runtime state are separate but both must be durable.

## Request Flow

When a user or integration sends a prompt:

```txt
POST /sessions/:id/messages or integration webhook
  -> validate request
  -> find or create session
  -> reject if the session is archived
  -> append pending message
  -> append message_created event
  -> return 202 Accepted
```

No model call happens in the request path.

Worker execution:

```txt
worker loop
  -> claim all pending messages for one session using Postgres transaction
  -> create/renew session run lease
  -> ensure sandbox exists and is healthy
  -> start Flue runner
  -> normalize Flue/sandbox events into event log
  -> record artifacts
  -> mark claimed batch completed, failed, or cancelled
  -> release lease
```

## Concurrency Model

Correctness must not depend on a single process.

Rules:

- Multiple API replicas may receive messages for the same session.
- Multiple worker replicas may poll concurrently.
- Only one active run may process a session at a time.
- Follow-up messages queue behind the active run. The worker claims all currently pending messages for a session as one ordered batch and prompts the runner with those messages in sequence.
- Pending messages can be edited or cancelled before claim. Editing pauses the session queue until the edit is saved or cancelled.
- Archived sessions are read-only. They must be restored before accepting new messages.
- Active run cancellation is two-phase: API requests cancellation, the run/messages enter `cancelling`, the owning worker aborts its runner signal, then the worker finalizes the run/messages as `cancelled`. `cancelling` still counts as an active run so another worker cannot claim the same session.
- Worker crashes must not permanently strand messages in `processing`.

Implementation mechanisms:

- `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for message claiming.
- Partial unique run index for `starting`, `running`, and `cancelling` states.
- Lease expiry and heartbeat timestamps.
- Dedicated cancellation polling while a run is active; default `RUN_CANCELLATION_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=1000`.
- Idempotent event writes where possible.
- Dedupe keys for external webhooks.

## Runner Interface

The worker should call a generic runner interface, not Flue directly.

```ts
interface Runner {
  run(input: RunnerInput): Promise<RunnerResult>;
}

type RunnerInput = {
  sessionId: string;
  runId: string;
  messageId: string;
  prompt: string;
  context: PromptContext;
  sandbox: SandboxHandle;
  signal?: AbortSignal;
  emit: (event: NormalizedEvent) => Promise<void>;
};
```

Implementations:

- `FakeRunner` for deterministic unit/e2e tests.
- `FlueRunner` for production.
- Future runners if needed.

`FlueRunner` responsibilities include:

- configure Flue with the Postgres-backed Flue session store;
- use stable Flue agent/session IDs derived from product session IDs;
- follow Flue's remote coding-agent pattern: create or connect a real sandbox, run setup in that sandbox, then initialize a project-scoped agent with `cwd` set to the cloned repo;
- call Flue `agent.session()` / `session.prompt()` / `session.skill()` / `session.task()` instead of implementing its own conversation or subagent system;
- call `session.abort()` when the worker cancellation signal aborts, and suppress post-abort events/results;
- grant product-authorized Flue tools, commands, and MCP tools;
- treat Flue session data as runner-owned state;
- persist normalized product events separately through the `events` module.

Do not implement a separate subagent runtime for Flue-backed sessions. Product runs are durable work records; intra-run delegation belongs to Flue `session.task()` and the built-in task tool.

For remote coding agents, the runner should mirror Flue's documented two-stage setup pattern:

```txt
connect/create provider sandbox
  -> init setup agent using sandbox
  -> clone/sync repo into /workspace/project
  -> run setup/install hooks
  -> init project agent with same sandbox and cwd=/workspace/project
  -> open stable Flue session
  -> prompt with the user request
```

Unlike the minimal Flue example, production code should persist the provider sandbox ID and reuse or reconnect it for follow-ups when policy allows.

## Sandbox Interface

```ts
interface SandboxProvider {
  create(input: CreateSandboxInput): Promise<SandboxHandle>;
  connect(input: ConnectSandboxInput): Promise<SandboxHandle>;
  start?(input: SandboxRef): Promise<void>;
  stop?(input: SandboxRef): Promise<void>;
  destroy(input: SandboxRef): Promise<void>;
  health(input: SandboxRef): Promise<SandboxHealth>;
}
```

Provider choices should be config-driven:

```txt
SANDBOX_PROVIDER=fake|local|local-docker|daytona|kubernetes|ecs
```

MVP should include `fake` for tests and one real provider.

## Streaming Model

The product event log is the source of truth for replay, audit, UI reconnects, and integration callbacks.

Flue already provides live execution events/SSE for the active invocation. The runner should consume those live events and persist normalized equivalents into the product event log.

Streaming endpoints should support replay:

```txt
GET /sessions/:id/events?after=<cursor>
GET /sessions/:id/events/stream?after=<cursor>
```

SSE is sufficient for MVP. WebSockets can be added later if bidirectional session control requires it.

## Trust Model

Trust boundaries are layered:

- Inbound requests are authenticated and deduped.
- External content is marked as untrusted in prompts.
- Integrations cannot run agents directly.
- Runner publishes events but cannot mutate session state except through worker-owned APIs.
- Publication actions such as PR creation should be explicit artifacts with verification.
- Destructive sandbox/provider operations require narrow interfaces.

The service is initially designed for trusted single-tenant organization deployments. Multi-tenant support requires explicit tenant isolation in the data model and authorization checks.
