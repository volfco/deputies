# Feature Backlog

This is a living backlog for product, integration, runtime, and operations work. It is not a release commitment.

## Integrations

- Slack start/queued status acknowledgement beyond reaction-only progress.
- Slack direct-message support.
- GitHub provider-owned push, branch, and PR helper operations using fresh installation access, sanitized branch names, and verified PR artifacts.
- Preview URL detection and surfacing from sandbox/deployment output, including final callback links for Slack/GitHub and context-panel artifacts in the web UI.
- GitHub collaborator permission gating in addition to the current repository, user, org, and trigger-phrase gates.
- GitHub label-based triggers for teams that want non-mention workflows.
- GitHub final callback links for provider-owned PR URLs after PR helpers exist.
- Continue consolidating shared integration utilities, especially allowlist helpers, prompt section rendering, and callback target parsing before adding the next major integration.
- Source-agnostic start/queued/final-response lifecycle so integrations add lightweight start signals while callback senders own exactly one final external reply.
- Global runner/agent instruction injection for integration behavior that should not appear in chat-visible source prompts.
- Linear integration for issue mentions, assignments, and comment follow-ups.
- Generic webhook mapping/filter/template configuration beyond the current simple payload shape.

## Web UI

- Session tagging, filtering, and grouping.
- Multiplayer-friendly session discovery controls without making sessions private by default.
- Session filters for all sessions, started by me, participated in, and tag-based views.
- User-selectable model, repository, branch, and execution settings.
- Repository picker with saved defaults per user/team/source.
- Session list pagination and server-side search.
- Pin/favorite sessions.
- Better run and sandbox status in the context panel.
- Preview URL cards in the context panel, with source, expiry/status, and quick-open/copy actions.
- Surface sandbox cleanup events and failures more clearly.
- Expand callback delivery UI with filtering and clearer retry/failure history.
- Improve archived-session browsing and bulk cleanup.
- Broader Playwright smoke tests for desktop/mobile flows beyond the existing responsive context-panel coverage.

## Agent Runtime

- Agent authentication to external services through MCP, CLI credentials, API tokens, and short-lived provider tokens.
- Harden and document OpenAI Codex subscription authentication, including `pnpm auth:login:openai-codex`, `FLUE_MODEL=openai-codex/<model>`, and `FLUE_OPENAI_CODEX_AUTH_FILE` override behavior.
- Credential scoping and injection policy for tools, commands, MCP servers, and sandbox environments.
- Multi-repository task support with one primary writable repo, auxiliary read-only context repos by default, and explicit multi-writable change sets when a task spans repos.
- Prompt templates and snapshot tests for Slack/GitHub/Linear inputs.
- Better repo resolution from Slack/GitHub/Linear context.
- Populate `repository list` from GitHub App installation repositories instead of only `GITHUB_ALLOWED_REPOSITORIES`, while keeping the allowlist enforced at webhook intake and runtime token minting.
- Setup/install hook observability beyond `repository_ready`.
- Preview URL artifact emission from agent tools and sandbox processes, with normalization for common local/dev-server/deployment URL patterns.
- Snapshot/image baking for common repos and build artifacts, with Flue startup refresh for stale or missing worktrees.
- Upstream Flue cancellation improvement for built-in bash/tool execution.

## Automations

- Automatic stale session archival when associated GitHub PRs are closed, plus an agent-accessible archive-thread tool for direct-to-main workflows after successful commit/push completion.
- Scheduled prompts for a session, repository, or integration source.
- Recurring tasks with cron-like schedules, timezone support, pause/resume, and failure backoff.
- One-off delayed tasks and reminders.
- Automation ownership, audit trail, run history, and last/next-run visibility in the web UI.
- Integration-triggered automations such as daily Slack summaries, weekly repository health checks, and scheduled GitHub issue/PR sweeps.
- Guardrails for max frequency, concurrency, allowed repositories/sources, and external callback behavior.
- Scheduler loop that enqueues normal messages into sessions instead of bypassing session/message/run invariants.

## Sandboxes

- Local Docker provider, distinct from the existing `local` host-subprocess development provider.
- Kubernetes provider.
- ECS/Fargate provider with bridge sidecar.
- Provider conformance test suite.
- Sandbox metrics for create/connect/start/stop/destroy latency.
- Let published live previews extend or hold sandbox idle timeout while users are actively viewing them, with provider-neutral limits and clear cleanup behavior.
- Object storage integration for large logs/artifacts.
- Repository-aware Daytona image or snapshot selection so common repos can use pre-baked dependencies instead of the global `DAYTONA_IMAGE` default.

## Scale And Operations

- Multiple product users and organizations with separate auth, session ownership, quotas, and audit trails.
- Session participants, including `createdByUserId` and users who send messages or otherwise participate.
- Session tags as a general metadata layer, starting with API/manual tags and later integration-derived tags such as `github:owner/repo`, `slack:channel`, and `repo:owner/name`.
- `GET /sessions` filters for `createdBy=me`, `participation=mine`, `tag=...`, and eventually source/repository filters.
- Preserve the shared workspace model: session filtering is for discovery and noise reduction, not an RBAC or visibility boundary.
- Per-user/per-team integration authorization policies for Slack, GitHub, Linear, and web UI entry points, beyond the current global allowlists.
- Metrics endpoint or structured timing logs.
- Pending-message, active-run, and worker-throughput dashboards.
- Session/event table pagination and retention policies.
- Deployment guides for Railway, ECS Fargate + RDS, and Kubernetes.
- Migration/release runbooks.
- Production readiness checklist.

## Testing

- Emulate-backed Slack callback tests in regular CI if reliable.
- Emulate-backed GitHub integration tests once the GitHub App JWT emulator caveat is resolved upstream.
- Real-provider smoke tests for Daytona on a schedule.
- Load profiles for session listing, event replay, SSE fanout, and worker throughput.
- Contract schemas for public API responses and normalized events.
