# Deputies

Deputies is a control plane for delegating engineering work to [background agents](https://background-agents.com/). It includes a fully featured web UI where each task gets a persistent session for queueing prompts, following live progress, reviewing diagnostics, inspecting artifacts, and managing callbacks from integrations like Slack, GitHub, or webhooks.

## What It Does

- Runs agent work in background sessions with a searchable activity history.
- Streams progress, tool diagnostics, and final responses into the web UI.
- Uses [Flue](https://github.com/withastro/flue) under the hood to run and resume agent work.
- Supports Slack and GitHub integrations for issue, thread, and callback-driven workflows.
- Supports GitHub OAuth login for browser access control.
- Works with [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/) as a remote sandbox provider, with local sandbox support for development (more sandbox providers coming soon!)
- Supports normal LLM API-key configuration, with OpenAI Codex / ChatGPT subscription-backed agent authentication as a bonus path.
- Tracks artifacts, callback deliveries, repositories, sandbox status, and queued messages.
- Easy to deploy anywhere: a React client, Node API, and Postgres-backed persistence.

## Project Layout

- `api/`: backend API, event stream, stores, integrations, workers, and sandbox providers.
- `web/`: React frontend for session management and agent progress review.
- `docs/`: architecture, domain notes, testing strategy, and feature backlog.
